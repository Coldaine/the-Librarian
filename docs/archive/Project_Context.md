# Project_Context.md

## Project Scope & Constraints

This is a **personal project** with a specific focus on **AI agent governance**:

- **Single developer** (you) working on implementation
- **AI agent coordination focus** - Preventing agents from making chaotic changes
- **Centralized control system** - All information flows through the Librarian
- **Immutable documentation** - Changes are controlled and tracked
- **Rapid iteration** cycles - may complete multiple "phases" in a day
- **Integration complexity is accepted** - we're pushing boundaries here
- **Documentation is for learning capture** not enterprise process

## Real Purpose

The Librarian is fundamentally a **control system for AI agents** working on your codebase. Without it, agents:
- Make arbitrary changes without coordination
- Write documentation in inconsistent locations
- Lack a single source of truth for project context
- Create chaos through uncontrolled modifications

With the Librarian:
- All agent interactions are mediated and controlled
- Documentation follows consistent standards
- Changes are tracked with immutable records
- Agents get consistent, authoritative context

## Success Criteria

- Do AI agents follow consistent documentation patterns when using the system?
- Are all code changes properly tracked and justified?
- Can the system prevent agents from making unauthorized modifications?
- Does it provide agents with the context they need to make good decisions?
- Is the implementation approach something you can build upon for future projects?

## Risk Tolerance

- Technical debt is acceptable for rapid progress
- Refactoring is expected and planned
- Some "hacks" for personal productivity are fine
- Focus on agent coordination effectiveness over perfection
